(1) Install Ruby and rake to run the rakefile.
(2) Install GHC.
(3) Install ImageMagick (to covert from PPM to GIF).
(4) Run "rake -T" to see the interesting tasks.

Running the rake tasks will give you ideas how to run "nofrac" for yourself.
Tweak the convert task to avoid the conversion (if you have some other way to
view PPM files).
